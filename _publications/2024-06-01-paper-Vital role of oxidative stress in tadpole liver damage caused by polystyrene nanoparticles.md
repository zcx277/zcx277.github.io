excerpt: 'Polystyrene nanoparticles are emerging as contaminants in freshwater environments, posing potential risks to amphibians exposed to extended periods of water contamination. Using tadpoles as a model, this study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of PS NPs. The primary objective of this research was to elucidate the adverse effects of prolonged PS NPs exposure on amphibians.'

This study elucidates the vital role of oxidative stress in tadpole liver damage induced by polystyrene nanoparticles (PS NPs), published in the peer-reviewed journal *Ecotoxicology and Environmental Safety* (Volume 277, 2024).

### Key Findings
1. PS NPs are emerging freshwater contaminants with potential ecotoxicity to amphibians.
2. Oxidative stress is a core mechanism driving PS NPs-induced liver damage in tadpoles.
3. The study provides empirical evidence for the environmental risks of nanoplastic pollution.
