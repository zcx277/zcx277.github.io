excerpt: 'Polystyrene nanoparticles are emerging as contaminants in freshwater environments, posing potential risks to amphibians exposed to extended periods of water contamination. Using tadpoles as a model, this study aimed to evaluate the toxicity of PS NPs. The primary objective of this research was to elucidate the adverse effects of prolonged PS NPs exposure on amphibians.'
